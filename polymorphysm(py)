Polymorphism with inheritance(method overriding)
Polymorphism often goes with inheritance. inheritance is when a child class gets features from a parent class. When a childgets a method from a oarent, it can redefine that method. This is called method overriding.
The child class creates its own specific way of doing the inherited method. It essentially replaces the parents method with its own version.
Here is an example. We have a vehicle parent class then we have car and motorcycle child classes:

class Vehicle:
    def describe(self): 

        print("This is a generic vehicle.")

class Car(Vehicle):
    print("This is a sporty car.")

class Motorcycle(Vehicle):
    def describe(self):
        print("This is a fast motorcycle.")

# make objects from each class
vehicle = Vehicle()
car = Car()
motorcycle = Motorcycle
	output:-
This is a sporty car.

we create a parent and child class to show method overriding. The child class customizes the number of sides in python for a square.

class Shape:
    def no_of_sides(self):
        print("This shape has many sides")
class Square(Shape):
    def no_of_sides(self):
        print("A square has 4 sides")

#creating objects

s1 = Shape()
s2 = Square()

# calling the method
s1.no_of_sides()#parent class method
s2.no_of_sides()# child class overriding the method
	output:-     This shape has many sides
                                   A square has 4 sides
